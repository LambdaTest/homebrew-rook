# Land the commit at HEAD on main through a pull request.
#
# Since 2 Nov 2026 main is under the org's "PR required" ruleset: one
# approval, the approver is not the last pusher, and nobody may bypass it.
# The release workflows can no longer push to main, so this pushes HEAD to
# a branch, opens a PR, waits for a maintainer to approve it and merges it
# (or notices that the maintainer merged it by hand).
#
# Like the direct push it replaces, it never lands a commit on a main that
# moved after the workflow checked it out: the PR is closed and the run
# fails, to be re-run against the new main.
#
# Usage: scripts/merge-via-pr.sh BRANCH_PREFIX TITLE [IF_LEFT_OPEN]
#   BRANCH_PREFIX  e.g. chore/rook-0.1.18; the run id is appended, so a
#                  re-run never pushes over an earlier run's branch. Open
#                  PRs from an earlier run with the same prefix are closed.
#   TITLE          PR title and the squash commit's subject
#   IF_LEFT_OPEN   what a maintainer must do after merging a PR this run
#                  gave up waiting on
#
# Needs GH_TOKEN with contents and pull-requests write, and an `origin` the
# checkout can push to. WAIT_SECONDS (default 5h30m, inside a hosted job's
# 6-hour limit) and POLL_SECONDS (default 30) exist for the test harness.
